As a developer, how many of you have gotten frustrated when your AI dev tool says you have to wait or start another chat session—and suddenly you've lost all context?

Well, I'm one of them. And after months of re-explaining my React setup, tech stack, and workflow every single time, I decided enough was enough.

That frustration led me to build Dev Workflow Generator—a simple PowerShell utility that solves this exact problem.

**What it does:**
One command analyzes your project and creates persistent context documentation. No more explaining your setup 50 times. Every AI conversation—whether with ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor, or any assistant—immediately understands your environment.

**The magic:**
- Auto-detects your tech stack (React, Python, Go, and 8+ more)
- Generates complete project documentation
- Creates tailored development workflows
- Bridges every chat session with seamless continuity

**The result:**
I went from fragmented AI sessions to a smooth, continuous coding experience. My flow state stays intact. AI assistants stay in context.

Sometimes the best solutions come from solving your own frustration.

Built this for developers who code with AI. Open source and free to use.
