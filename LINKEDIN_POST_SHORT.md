How many of you who use AI for coding have gotten frustrated when your AI tool says you have to wait or start another chat sessionâ€”and you've lost all context?

Well, I'm one of them. ðŸ˜¤

After months of explaining my React setup over and over, I built a simple solution: Dev Workflow Generator.

Just run one PowerShell command once per project to set it up.

Then each session:
- Run startup script â†’ checks context, ensures dependencies installed, ready to code
- Code with AI â†’ context docs available for reference
- Run closeout script â†’ updates context with your latest changes

Next session, your AI assistant has all your latest project state automatically.

No more re-explaining your setup 50 times. Every new AI chat session picks up exactly where the last one left off.

Auto-detects your tech stack. Works with any AI assistant. Open source.

Sometimes the best solutions come from solving your own daily frustration.

Built for anyone who codes with AI. What frustrations have you solved lately?
